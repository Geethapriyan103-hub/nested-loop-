⭐ 3x3 Star Pattern using Nested Loops

This project demonstrates how to print a simple 3x3 pattern of asterisks (*) using nested loops in your preferred programming language.

📌 Pattern Output
* * *
* * *
* * *

💻 How It Works

The pattern is generated using two nested loops:

The outer loop runs for each row.

The inner loop prints * for each column in that row.

🧾 Example Code (Python)
rows = 3
cols = 3

for i in range(rows):
    for j in range(cols):
        print("*", end=" ")
    print()


You can adapt this logic in other languages like C, C++, Java, or JavaScript.

🛠️ Languages

Currently supports:

✅ Python
(You can extend this with more examples in other languages.)
